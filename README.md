# Il-Mago-Oberon
This project was developed for the course "Programmazione 1" attended in the first year of my bachelor's degree.
The project was totally developped using C and its goal was to create a videogame in which the user can define a sequence of World, in each of these a Monster to defeat.
Then the user will assume the role of the mage Oberon and will try to defeat all the monsters in the journey. 

From the academic point of view the purpose of the project was to understand properly the use of pointers and memory management in C.
